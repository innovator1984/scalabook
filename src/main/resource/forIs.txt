The Wall Street Journal reports that Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer stands to make about $186m (£145m)
following the sale of the core internet business to Verizon, securities filings reveal.

"The hefty pay out comes despite Ms. Mayer’s inability to accomplish what she was hired to do five years ago:
revitalize the fading internet icon following its struggles with high employee and executive turnover and declines in ad revenue," the Journal says.

The $4.5bn sale is expected to close in June after months of delays. Yahoo shareholders vote on the deal on 8 June.

Ms Mayer (and other executives) will get all their stock options paid out, which for her are worth $109m,
on top of the 1.6 million Yahoo shares she owns that are valued at nearly $77m.
